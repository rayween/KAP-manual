## Manage Access Permission

When a user/group uses KAP, whether the user/group can access a project and use some functionalities within the project is determined by project-level access control, there are four types of access permission role set at the project-level in KAP. They are *ADMIN*, *MANAGEMENT*, *OPERATION* and *QUERY*. Each role defines a list of functions user/group may perform in KAP system. 

- *QUERY*: designed to be used by analysts who only need access permission to query tables/cubes in the project.
- *OPERATION*: designed to be used by operation team in a corporate/organization who need permission to maintain the Cube. OPERATION access permission includes QUERY.
- *MANAGEMENT*: designed to be used by Modeler or Designer who is fully knowledgeable of business meaning of the data/model, Cube will be in charge of Model and Cube design. MANAGEMENT access permission includes OPERATION, and QUERY.
- *ADMIN*: Designed to fully manage the project. ADMIN access permission includes MANAGEMENT, OPERATION and QUERY.

Access permissions are independent between different projects. 

###How Access Permission is Determined

Once project-level access permission has been set for a user/group, access permission on data source, model and Cube will be inherited based on the access permission role defined on project-level. For detailed functionalities, each access permission role can have access to, see table below.

Additionally, when Query Pushdown is enabled, QUERY access permission on a project allows users/groups to issue push down queries on all tables in the project even though no cube could serve them. It's impossible if a user/group is not yet granted QUERY permission at project-level.

### Manage Access Permission at Project-level

#### Grant Access 

![Grant access](images/acl/1.png)

Follow below steps to grant access at project-level: 

1. Click on project icon on the right side of project list on the navigation bar.
2. Expand a project on the project list.
3. Click `Access` menu  and then click `+Grant` menu to grant access for a user/group.
4. Fill in a user name/group name, access permission and click `save`.

1. Click on project icon on the right side of project list on the navigation bar.
2. Expand a project on the project list.
3. Click `Access` menu and click `Edit` 
4. Modify user/group's access permission and click `save`. 

####Revoke Access

Follow below steps to revoke access at project-level:

2. Expand a project on the project list.
3. click `Access` menu, choose a user/group, and then click `Delete` .

When user/group's project access permission has been revoked, all access permission on this project will be revoked/dropped subsequently, this may include table-level, row-level and column-level if there is any.
