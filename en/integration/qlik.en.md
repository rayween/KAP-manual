## Integration with Qlik Sense

Qlik Sense delivers intuitive platform solutions for self-service data visualization, guided analytics applications, embedded analytics and reporting. It is a new player in the Business Intelligence (BI) tools world, with a high growth since 2013. It has connectors with Hadoop Database (Hive and Impala). Now it can be integrated with KAP. This article will guide you to connect KAP with Qlik Sense.  

### Install Kyligence ODBC Driver

For the installation information, please refer to [Kyligence ODBC Driver tutorial](../driver/kyligence-odbc.en.md).

#### Install Qlik Sense

For the installation of Qlik Sense, please visit [Qlik Sense Desktop download](https://www.qlik.com/us/try-or-buy/download-qlik-sense).

### Connection with Qlik Sense
After configuring your Local DSN and installing Qlik Sense successfully, you may go through the following steps to connect Kylin with Qlik Sense.

1. From Windows Desktop Shortcut or click **Start -> All Applications -> Qlik Sense -> Qlik Sense Desktop** to open the application **Qlik Sense Desktop**.

2. Input your Qlik account to login, then the following dialog will pop up. Click **Create New Application**.

![Create New Application](images/qlik/welcome_to_qlik_desktop.png)

You may specify any name different from existing applications and then open this application. In this example, we name it as â€œKylinfortesting".

![Specify a unique name](images/qlik/create_new_application.png)

3. There are two choices in the Application View. Please select the bottom **Script Editor**.

![Select Script Editor](images/qlik/script_editor.png)

The Data Load Editor window shows. Click **Create New Connection** in the upper right of this page.

![Create New Data Connection](images/qlik/create_data_connection.png)

Select **DSN** you have created, ignore the account information, and then click **Create**.

4. Change the default scripts of "TimeFormat", "DateFormat" and "TimestampFormat" to:

`SET TimeFormat='h:mm:ss';`
`SET DateFormat='YYYY-MM-DD';`
`SET TimestampFormat='YYYY-MM-DD h:mm:ss[.fff]';`

5. Configure Direct Query mode

Given the Peta-byte scale Cube size in a usual production KAP environment, we recommend user to use Direct Query mode in Qlik Sense and avoid importing data into Qlik sense.

You may be able to enable Direct Query mode by typing `Direct Query` in front of your query script in Script editor.

Below is the screenshot of such Direct Query script against *kylin_sales_cube* in *Learn_kylin* project. 

![Script](images/qlik/script_run_result.png)

Once you defined such script, Qlik sense can generate SQL based on this script for your report.

It is recommended that you define Dimension and Measure corresponding to the Dimension and Measure in the Kylin Cube.  

The whole script has been posted for your reference. 

You may also be able to utilize KAP built-in functions by creating a Native expression, for example: 

`NATIVE('extract(month from PART_DT)') ` 

```sql
SET ThousandSep=',';
SET DecimalSep='.';
SET MoneyThousandSep=',';
SET MoneyDecimalSep='.';
SET MoneyFormat='$#,##0.00;-$#,##0.00';
SET TimeFormat='h:mm:ss';
SET DateFormat='YYYY/MM/DD';
SET TimestampFormat='YYYY/MM/DD h:mm:ss[.fff]';
SET FirstWeekDay=6;
SET BrokenWeeks=1;
SET ReferenceDay=0;
SET FirstMonthOfYear=1;
SET CollationLocale='en-US';
SET CreateSearchIndexOnReload=1;
SET MonthNames='Jan;Feb;Mar;Apr;May;Jun;Jul;Aug;Sep;Oct;Nov;Dec';
SET LongMonthNames='January;February;March;April;May;June;July;August;September;October;November;December';
SET DayNames='Mon;Tue;Wed;Thu;Fri;Sat;Sun';
SET LongDayNames='Monday;Tuesday;Wednesday;Thursday;Friday;Saturday;Sunday';

LIB CONNECT TO 'KAP';

```

Click **Load Data** on the upper right of the window, Qlik sense will send out inspection query to test the connection based on the script.

6. Create a new report

On the top left manu open **App Overview**.

![Open App Overview](images/qlik/go_to_app_overview.png)

 Click **Create new sheet** on this page.

![Create new sheet](images/qlik/create_new_report.png)

Select the charts you need, then add dimension and measurement based on your requirements. 

![Select the required charts, dimension and measure](images/qlik/add_dimension.png)

You will get your worksheet and the connection is complete. Your KAP data shows in Qlik Sense now.

![View KAP data in Qlik Sense](images/qlik/report.png)

Please note that if you want the report to hit on Cube, you need to create the measure eaxctly as those are defined in the Cube. For the case of *Kylin_sales_cube* in Learn_kylin project. We use sum(price) as an example.
